# TimeFloat

👋 Hello there! 🕰️ TimeFloat is a simple clock that is especially useful when your taskbar is set to automatically hide. Built with Tauri and React, styled with TailwindCSS, it's a lightweight desktop application that displays the current time in a sleek and unobtrusive manner. 🖥️ Just hover over the app and it will conveniently hide the clock for 5 seconds. ⏱️ Enjoy! 😊
